        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a tutorial 
        showing the process of arranging textures in a 2D application and applying 
        them in a 3D package. The entire process from the very beginning to the 
        final adjustment of the shaders is covered. <br>
        You need the following software(s) to follow the tutorial:<br>
        - a 2D paint application able to deal with layer based workflow. (I used 
        Photoshop here)<br>
        - a 3D application (almost every common package will be just fine here, 
        I used 3ds max 6.0 along with Mental Ray to complete the task).<br>
        - a copy of &quot;Total Textures Vol. 8: Cars&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I assume that you 
        are familiar with the most common tools in Photoshop and your 3D application 
        (just named &#132;3ds max&quot;from here on.) You do not need any artistic 
        skills in painting although it is never a bad thing in case you have them. 
        J<br>
        The two images above show the end result of this tutorial, so let's just 
        start with getting our textures ready in Photoshop.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_1.jpg" width="700" height="504"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you can see here 
        I went away from the polished look of high gloss coated cars, but instead 
        I decided to create a dirty/ muddy look on our car using the dirtmaps 
        included on the Total Textures CD. <br>
        I created a new document placing the textures in a way that they fit nicely 
        along with each other. <br>
        Note: Most of the textures that come along with the CD are very well tileable 
        but I wanted to give you a short look at how things can be touched up 
        early in the creation process and how you can create unique looking textures 
        in just a few steps. <br>
        So let us just fill out the gaps in the texture that will later be covering 
        the side of the car.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_2.jpg" width="700" height="504"></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just use your eyedropper 
        tool to grab the needed color and start to fill in the space with a quite 
        noisy brush type. Go on with adding darker spots trying to imitate the 
        look of the original map.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_3.jpg" width="700" height="504"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's how it looked 
        just after a few minutes painting in Photoshop.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_4.jpg" width="700" height="504"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use the clone stamp 
        tool to copy/paste in the missing dots/ splats right in between the two 
        maps.<br>
        That looks already quite satisfying but the straight border on the top 
        really distracts from a realistic look.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_5.jpg" width="700" height="504"></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        We will work around that problem by just giving that border some randomness 
        by using the eraser tool. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_6.jpg" width="700" height="504"></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just one more gap 
        to fill out here, all the techniques that you have just used will come 
        in very handy on this task. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_7.jpg" width="700" height="504"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is my result 
        after just a few minutes more. That should already be a nice dirtmap on 
        our car, but I want to go one step further, I actually would like to see 
        some race numbers on the door that will partially be covered by the mud 
        on the side of the car. And this is the process of how to create such 
        an effect: Make a copy of your base layer and choose any race number you 
        wish to use on your car. </font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_8.jpg" width="700" height="504"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use the magic wand 
        tool to select all the white areas of the map and invert your selection. 
        </font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_9.jpg" width="700" height="504"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now simply drag and 
        drop your selection just between your base layer and its copy.<br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_10.jpg" width="700" height="504"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mark all the black 
        areas of the top layer by again making use of the magic wand tool. You 
        might want to use rather low pixel tolerance values here.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_11.jpg" width="700" height="504"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Next step is to delete 
        your selection and the underlying race number will appear but still being 
        partially covered by the remaining muddy part of the above layer. <br>
        We leave the map at this stage for just a few minutes and will now move 
        on to 3ds max to prepare the car for the mapping process.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_12.jpg" width="700" height="525"></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_13.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is the car I 
        will be using further on in this tutorial. </font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_14.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hide everything except 
        the cars body and create a new blend material in the material editor. 
        I already have created the base shader for the car which is a simple raytrace 
        material. I included the setting for my base material in the following 
        image:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_mat_setup.jpg" width="700" height="1307"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few notes on the 
        shader though: using specific falloffs on the diffuse and reflect channel 
        is very common method, but I wanted to achieve the certain look of metallic 
        flakes inside the paint surface. In case you have a 3rd party plugin like 
        Splutterfish Brazil this a very easy task since it features that stuff 
        right out of the box.<br>
        In case you don't have it just apply the above settings to your shader. 
        The idea behind it is to affect the specular level of the material in 
        such a way that is shows areas with very high specular (i.e. the metal 
        flakes) and other areas with lower specular- the remaining car paint. 
        <br>
        It is also possible to use any of the shaders included on the Total Texture 
        CD as well of course. <br>
        But back to our newly created blend material. Fill both of its slots with 
        a raytrace material and leave everything else at default settings.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_15.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Move to level 0 of 
        your mesh and select all the faces that defines the side of car. Now add 
        a UVW map modifier to the step WITHOUT de-selecting your faces. Since 
        the cars side is an almost planar surface we will do just fine with a 
        simple planar projection type. Don't forget to apply your blend material 
        to the polygon selection at this stage.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_16.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Add an Unwrap UVW 
        modifier to stack and click on the &quot;Edit&quot; button. You should 
        see an result similar to the image above.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_17.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now go back to the 
        material editor and drag/drop a copy of your cars base shader in the first 
        slot, move to the diffuse channel of the second slot and put in the map 
        you have just painted in Photoshop. Click on the &quot;Show map in viewport&quot; 
        button to be able to see your result. </font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_18.jpg" width="700" height="525"></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_19.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        You will most likely find out that the map does not fit perfectly to the 
        shape of your cars body. And that is the time when our Unwrap UVW modifier 
        will become useful.<br>
        You just have to pull/push the points in the Edit UVWs window and you'll 
        see the viewport updating in realtime. Adjust the map to your needs now. 
        <br>
        It might also occur to you that your decals or -in our case- race number 
        does not sit in the correct place. If that's the case head back to Photoshop 
        and simply move only the middle layer of your entire map and save your 
        changes and see how 3ds max will update to those changes immediately. 
        I had to adjust the size and position in my case. Once you are satisfied 
        with the placement you should flatten the image in Photoshop and safe 
        it as a TGA file for example. </font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_20.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take this map, desaturate 
        it and increase the contrast to a maximum. Safe it under a different name, 
        go back to 3ds max and put the just created map into the &quot;mask&quot; 
        slot of your blend material. Now it is time for a first testrender of 
        our car.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_21.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, that looks pretty 
        much like the side of a car covered in mud to me. Note: I already have 
        applied a bump map to the dirtmap in the image. To create a sufficient 
        bumpmap in Photoshop you should hide the layer with your decals/ racenumbers 
        etc. because you will probably not want to see them embossed on the cars 
        surface. Flatten the image then and desaturate it in order to get a grayscale 
        image. Use this map in the bumpmap channel. You may want to play around 
        in Photoshop to achieve certain results in 3ds max. For example try other 
        decals, deal with lower or higher contrast settings to affect the coverage 
        rate of the dirt etc. But basically this is the process of placing maps, 
        decals, sponsors, numbers, flames, tribals etc. on your cars surface. 
        To keep things easy here I just explained this process on a small portion 
        of the car. In case you have hundreds of decals to place, it would be 
        a very painful job to select a few polys everytime, apply a blend material 
        to it, unwrap it and so on and on. In such a case you would probably want 
        to unwrap the car as a whole and create a single surface map in Photoshop. 
        The setup of such a map would of course take you longer than this one 
        here but in the end it is much more efficient. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_22.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I went on a little 
        further and placed a few other maps on the cars surface. I wanted to achieve 
        the look of a car that has just been out racing on a muddy racetrack. 
        </font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_23.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a quickly 
        rendered image of my car so far. Finally I want to put this car in a little 
        scene for a more realistic look.</font></p>

      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_25.jpg" width="700" height="525"></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the scene 
        I set up for this tutorial. As you can see in the images there is nothing 
        very fancy going on there. Modeling is quite simply and the texturing 
        is -except the ground- pretty straight forward with just diffuse and bump 
        mapping. To make the cars muddy appearance a little more believable I 
        covered the ground partially with water puddles. The technique for this 
        is again the same as for surfacing the car. A blend material, one of the 
        slots containing the dry map, the other one containing a reflective water 
        shader mixed together by a procedural noise map in the mask slot. The 
        scene has been lit with an area light and final gather only.</font></p>
      <p><img src="graphics/tut_brosdau_Capture_26.jpg" width="700" height="525"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is just a quick 
        testrender without antialiasing, you can see the final result on the top 
        of this tutorial. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, that is pretty 
        much it for this tutorial, I hope you found it useful in some way. <br>
        I haven't discovered any new texturing phenomena in here but it should 
        give you a good look on how to use textures in general and the ones on 
        this Texture CD in special. But there are not only a lot of very useful 
        textures on this CD instead you will also find pre-made rims, paintshaders 
        and other stuff like that on it. I used a set of those rims on the studio-like 
        render on the top. <br>
        I recommend this CD to everyone who needs to do high quality renders of 
        cars and other vehicles, because you find some textures and samples on 
        this CD that are indeed very hard to find elsewhere. </font></p>
